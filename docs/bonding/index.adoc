[#bonding]
= Bonding

ifndef::tbtc[toc::[]]

Because signers are able to collude to censor withdrawals or abscond with funds,
a bond is required per deposit from each backing signer.

Unlike the staked work tokens used to choose signers, signer bonds need to be a
liquid asset with a large market cap. This restriction increases the cost of
market-based attacks, where the price of bonded collateral can be pushed up or
down by market manipulation.

Bonded signers offer depositors recourse in the case of colluding signers
interfering with operation. A signing group that doesn't sign within a timeout
forfeits their bond; a signing group that provably signs unauthorized material
forfeits their bond, and risks their work token stake.

== Acceptable collateral

Two tokens present themselves as obvious choices for signing bond collateral--
TBTC and the underlying work token. During the bootstrap phase of the network,
neither is an appropriate candidate due to low liquidity.

Since signer bonds need to be denominated in a widely traded asset to avoid
market manipulation, the next most obvious pick for bonding is the host chain's
native token. For the initial release of tBTC, that means ETH. As the ecosystem
matures, other bond collateral options might become feasible at the expense of a
more complex implementation.

== Measuring security

:lot-size: 1 BTC

Clearly, security concerns require signing bonds that are proportional to the
size of a _Deposit_. To maintain a negative expected value from signers
colluding, the amount forfeited by misbehaving signers must be strictly greater
than the amount they have to gain. Assuming a lot size of {lot-size}, constant
exchange rate between BTC and the bonded asset, and a
M-of-N group of signers backing a _Deposit_, the minimum collateral for each
signer is `({lot-size})/M`, denominated in the asset being bonded, ETH in the base
case.

Example: Consider a 1 BTC _Deposit_ backed by a 3-of-5 group of Signers. In the
worse case, 3 of the signers can be malicious and try to steal the Deposit,
which would net them each 1/3 BTC. As a result, all 5 Signers must bond 0.33 BTC
each, denominated in ETH.

== Pricing currency fluctuations

The above assumes a constant exchange rate between BTC and ETH, but in truth
the two currencies fluctuate relative to each other, sometimes wildly.

=== ETH Price Drop relative to BTC

:extracollateral: 50%
:totalcollateral: 150%

If the value of ETH drops precipitously relative to BTC, then the dollar value
of the ETH bonded by the signers can be less than the dollar value of the BTC
Deposit they have backed, meaning they have positive expected value if they try
to steal the BTC.

In order to avoid that, we require that the bonds are overcollateralized. For
each ETH they collateralize, they must put up an additional {extracollateral}, for a total of
{totalcollateral} collateralization rate.

**Without overcollateralization:** Let 1 BTC be worth $10000, and 1 ETH be worth $200. Signers have to put up 50 ETH
to back a deposit. Due to market conditions, ETH drops 25% to $150, while
BTC maintains its value. The 50 ETH is worth $7500, meaning the Signers can make
a $2500 profit by stealing the Deposit.

**With overcollateralization:** Let 1 BTC be worth $10,000, and 1 ETH be worth
$200. Signers have to put up 75 ETH (150% of 50) to back a deposit. Due to market conditions,
ETH drops 25% to $150, while
BTC maintains its value. The 75 ETH is worth $11250, which is above the dollar
value of BTC meaning the Signers will maintain honest behavior since they have
more to lose.

In general, total overcollateralization of {totalcollateral} (`3/2 * 100%`) keeps Signer
incentives aligned with the well-being of the system up to a 33% drop (`(1 -
2/3) * 100%`) in price of the bonded asset against the Deposit's asset.
Increasing this percentage can increase the robustness of the system, at
the expense of opportunity cost to the Signers which should be compensated via fees.

If the value of ETH crosses a security threshold, open _Deposit_ s will enter
<<preliq, pre-liquidation>>, followed by <<liq, liquidation>> if they do not top
up their collateral.

// TODO insert a little historical analysis for a decent starting number

=== BTC price drop relative to ETH

Since <<Custodial Fees>> are denominated per BTC in custody (with
overcollateralization factored in), a BTC value drop against the
bonded asset translates in lower fees for Signers. Note that this does not
create any issue for tBTC reserves, but it makes the system less attractive to
signers looking to earn interest via fees on their assets.

Signers SHOULD buy TBTC from the markets in anticipation of such overly
overcollateralized Deposits and they SHOULD use it to redeem these positions,
thus reclaiming their ETH liquidity which can be used to back other Deposits. An
alternative would be to provide Signers with the ability to safely rebalance their
bonds back to {totalcollateral}, however that introduces implementation
complexities and as a result is not the preferred solution for the initial
deployment of the mechanism.

Example:
Let 1 BTC be worth $10,000, and 1 ETH be worth $200. Signers have to put up 75
ETH to back a deposit. Signers are expected to make a custodial fee of 5 basis
points for $15,000 (150% of $10,000): $7.5. Due to market conditions, ETH soars
25% to $250, while BTC maintains its value. The Signers still get $7.5 per BTC
under custody, however the 75 ETH is worth $18750 (hence 187.5%
overcollateralized), meaning 5 basis points for its custody would be $9.375. A
signer redeems the Deposit by paying 1 TBTC, reclaiming 1 BTC and unlocking the
75 ETH which was locked by all Signers. All significantly overcollateralized Signers now
have liquid ETH which they can use to back another deposit to mint new TBTC.

== A resilient price oracle

Unlike popular synthetic stablecoin schemes, the tBTC system design makes no
effort to stabilize the value of TBTC relative to BTC -- TBTC will be priced by
the market. Instead, the goal is to ensure that the TBTC supply is strictly
less than its backing BTC reserves.

For this reason, the only price relationship the system needs to understand is
between the signing bond collateral and BTC.

In concrete terms, that means the price of ETH to BTC. Due to only needing
prices for a single pair of assets, tBTC will initially use a simple
<<price-discovery/index.adoc#price-discovery,price oracle>>.

== Undercollateralization

// TODO explain the undercollateralization curve
=== Pre-liquidation: a courtesy call
[[preliq]]

:preliquidation-period: 6 hours
:first-threshold: 125%
:second-threshold: 110%

At the first threshold of  {first-threshold}, a _Deposit_ enters
pre-liquidation.
Pre-liquidation indicates that the signers should close the _Deposit__ or face forced
liquidation after a pre-liquidation period. If the _Deposit_ is not closed within {preliquidation-period}, or
if the _Deposit_ collateral falls below {second-threshold} collateralization,
liquidation will follow. This gives each signer an incentive to close the
position before it becomes severely undercollateralized. Alternatively, if the
ETHBTC ratio recovers such that the deposit becomes at least {first-threshold}
collateralized during the {preliquidation-period} the Deposit is safe and is
moved away from the pre-liquidation state.

In future versions of the system, more complex pre-liquidation mechanisms could
be introduced. For the initial version it seems prudent to choose a simple
mechanism with large penalties for ongoing undercollateralization. In addition,
by incentivizing redemption of undercollateralized or significantly overcollateralized
positions, Signers are protected from being long ETH for long periods of time.

=== Liquidation
[[liq]]

:auction-start-percent: 80%

Forced liquidation should be rare, as rational signers will redeem _Deposits_
before liquidation becomes necessary. However, the possibility of extreme
punishment via liquidation is necessary to prevent dishonest behavior from
signers. Liquidation may occur because because signers didn't produce a valid
signature  in response a redemption request, because the value of the signing
bond dropped below the liquidation threshold, because they did not respond to the
courtesy call, or because the signers produced a fraudulent signature.
// comment(Georgios): What does unauthorized signature mean here?

The primary goal of the liquidation process is to bring the TBTC supply in line
with the BTC custodied by _Deposits_. The most valuable asset held by the
system is the signers' bonds. Therefore, the liquidation process seizes the
signers bonds and attempts to use the bonded value to purchase and burn TBTC.

First, the contract attempts to use on-chain liquidity sources, such as
https://hackmd.io/@477aQ9OrQTCbVR3fq1Qzxg/HJ9jLsfTz[Uniswap].

If the bond is sufficient to cover the outstanding TBTC value on these
markets, it is immediately exchanged for TBTC.

Second, the contract starts a falling-price auction. It offers
{auction-start-percent} of the signer bond for sale for the outstanding TBTC
amount. The amount of bond on sale increases over time until someone chooses
to purchase it, or the auction reaches 100% of the bond. The auction will
remain open until a buyer is found.

TBTC received during this process is burned to maintain the supply peg. If any
bond value is left after liquidation, a small fee is distributed to the account
which triggered the liquidation. After that, any remaining value is either
distributed to the signers (in case of liquidation due to
undercollateralization) or burned (in case of liquidation due to fraud).

What the unresponsive signers do with the BTC outside the tBTC system design is
for them to decide-- it might be split up, stolen by a signing majority, or
lost permanently.

Example:
1. Signers guard a deposit of 1 BTC, backed by 75 ETH at 0.02 BTC/ETH (1.5 BTC
in ETH, 150% collateralization ratio).

1. ETH price drops to 0.01333 BTC/ETH. 75 ETH now only collateralizes 100% of
the Deposit (1 BTC / 75 ETH)

1. Liquidation is triggered and the 75 ETH is seized to buy back TBTC.

1. Assuming Uniswap has only 0.8 TBTC available in its reserves, that amount is
bought, at market price, for 60 ETH (`0.8 BTC / (1/75) = 60`) and is
subsequently burned. Note that there may be slippage here so the contract SHOULD
check that it does not purchase TBTC at non-favorable rates

1. The Deposit is left with 15 ETH which must be used to purchase 0.2 TBTC. In
an attempt to get a discount, it auctions {auction-start-percent} of its ETH
reserves.

1. An arbitrageur burns 0.2 TBTC at 90% of the auction and obtains 13.5 ETH. The
liquidation of the Deposit is now over.

1. The remaining 1.4 ETH is distributed to the signers (if they had committed
fraud it'd be burned), and 0.1 ETH is given to the account which called the
liquidation function on the Ethereum smart contract.

1. The N signers coordinate and agree on how they will distribute the 1 BTC deposit.
